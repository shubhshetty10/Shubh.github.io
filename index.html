        <h4>Nurse Calling System:</h4>
        <p>In the development of the Nurse Calling System project, I led a team to create a crucial healthcare solution
            designed to enhance patient care and efficiency in medical facilities. This system enables patients to
            summon nurses at their bedside with the press of a button, ensuring prompt assistance when needed. I was
            responsible for designing the hardware components, including wireless transmitters and receivers, as well as
            developing the software interface that seamlessly integrates with hospital workflows. The project not only
            showcased my proficiency in embedded systems and wireless communication but also highlighted my commitment
            to improving healthcare through innovative technology.

        <h4>Gesture Recognition Glove:</h4>
        <p>The Gesture Recognition Glove project represents my exploration into the realm of human-computer interaction
            and wearable technology. I designed and developed a glove equipped with sensors and an embedded
            microcontroller that enables users to control digital devices and applications through intuitive hand
            gestures. This project reflects my expertise in sensor integration, real-time data processing, and machine
            learning algorithms. It also underscores my dedication to creating user-friendly and immersive technology
            experiences. The Gesture Recognition Glove project exemplifies my passion for pushing the boundaries of
            human-computer interaction, making technology more accessible and interactive for users in various domains.
